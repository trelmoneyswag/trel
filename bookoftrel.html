                     feel like i cant do it again (after getting back together). we arent official rn but 
                     he acts like we are. honestly i dont even think about him on a daily basis unless hes
                      like "hey its been a while since we talked" like i dont wanna be with him. but hes
                       obsessed and

                        Hi friend ! If you owe this man anything you owe him honesty! 
                        You do not owe him a relationship or affection. But!!! I think 
                        a really important part of being generally kind to yourself and
                         to others is to be honest and to act on honesty. What joy do you 
                         get being in relationship (not A relationship) with a man that you
                          do not think about. I’m assuming you want better for yourself? yeah?
                           And if he is a nice guy, maybe he deserves someone who thinks about 
                           him in an equal way. The hardest thing you can do is turn down affection,
                            but i really think you have to!! And idk anything about this man but he 
                            should maybe be strong enough to realize you cant give him what you need.
                             Unfortunately we’re not in an economy where that happens for men. So i think you 
                             need to be brave and i hate to say it. BREAK UP AGAIN. And do no contact too so 
                             you can’t fall into it again.

                            Would a partner make <br>
                            You feel less alone? Do you <br>
                            Have your own comfort? <br>
                            <br>
                            This was hard to put into a haiku but my brutal honesty is that 
                            being chronically single is hard! Certainly it is hard (not that 
                            i can relate, but I want to validate this), but also it is a lie.
                            You have so much capacity for love. I think it can be hard when you 
                            are surrounded by people in LTR esp roommates because you see all the 
                            little things you are missing. But also !! relationships are hard and 
                            a lot of work and often come at a cost (and its beautiful when it works
                             out and the cost is so deeply worth it). Relationships will come and 
                             likely they will go. You know what will never leave you? Memories made 
                             with your best friends in your college years. The connection and joy of 
                             friendship. So don’t focus on some hypothetical romantic partner that 
                             would make you feel better bc you have these models of romance in your 
                             life (tbh the relationships probably are hard and theyre not telling you).
                              Focus on whats in front of you. Chin up king, head down focus on whats real. 
                              What you can touch and what you can love.

                <p>
                    Rats is a little bonkers bananas. Not a mouse??? Not mice??? Like a full chunky RAT?? 
                    Anyway. My genuine advice to you is that you should call workbox or get a humane rat trap
                     (if you don’t go to this fine institution.) I think truly there’s no emotional support i 
                     can give to you because when I was 6 I had a mouse infestation and then they mice started 
                     dying in my walls and I jsut lived with the smell of decomposing mouse for 1 month. 
                     I actually have so little sympathy for this. Just deal with it.

                        Hmmm I’m going to assume this is a STEM class because of the levels… and i think 
                        maybe you want someone to tell you that it is going to be okay, you asked for brutal 
                        honesty and so I honestly cannot say that. I wish I could offer comfort but really I 
                        want to ask why you have to? I’m assuming its because you want a certain major for a 
                        certain career?? You may think you have to, but my guess is you are really not comfortable 
                        with change. I cannot offer you comfort and tell you that you will pass this class or the 
                        next (you may! I just don’t know who you are or any more details). But I can say that 
                        failure is okay and it will be okay. Changing your major or your career does not mean 
                        you fundamentally change as a person. I think it is easy to forget this. You are going 
                        to be okay but change may be coming your way and that is really scary. Try not to let it 
                        stop you from being all the other 
                        things that make you great (kind, caring, a good friend).
