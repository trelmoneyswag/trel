                    just. i thought i could take it but i really just am getting the ick. i feel like i 
                    cant actually like ... be with him but also since i already brokw up with him once i
                     feel like i cant do it again (after getting back together). we arent official rn but 
                     he acts like we are. honestly i dont even think about him on a daily basis unless hes
                      like "hey its been a while since we talked" like i dont wanna be with him. but hes
                       obsessed and
                     he wants smtg serioud and i just feel like i owe him something."

                        Hi friend ! If you owe this man anything you owe him honesty! 
                        You do not owe him a relationship or affection. But!!! I think 
                        a really important part of being generally kind to yourself and
                         to others is to be honest and to act on honesty. What joy do you 
                         get being in relationship (not A relationship) with a man that you
                          do not think about. I’m assuming you want better for yourself? yeah?
                           And if he is a nice guy, maybe he deserves someone who thinks about 
                           him in an equal way. The hardest thing you can do is turn down affection,
                            but i really think you have to!! And idk anything about this man but he 
                            should maybe be strong enough to realize you cant give him what you need.
                             Unfortunately we’re not in an economy where that happens for men. So i think you 
                             need to be brave and i hate to say it. BREAK UP AGAIN. And do no contact too so 
                             you can’t fall into it again.

            <h3> Dilemma: "i have rats in my room "
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Rats is a little bonkers bananas. Not a mouse??? Not mice??? Like a full chunky RAT?? 
                    Anyway. My genuine advice to you is that you should call workbox or get a humane rat trap
                     (if you don’t go to this fine institution.) I think truly there’s no emotional support i 
                     can give to you because when I was 6 I had a mouse infestation and then they mice started 
                     dying in my walls and I jsut lived with the smell of decomposing mouse for 1 month. 
                     I actually have so little sympathy for this. Just deal with it.
