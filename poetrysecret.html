    <summary> Letter to My Past Life </summary>
    <p>
        I wonder who loved you like that <br>
        To make me love like this <br>
        What did it feel like, <br>
        That senseless joy? <br>
        You had to be<br>
        the object of hopeful devotion.<br>
        Why else am I searching<br>
        to be loved like <br>
        you must have been?<br>
        Was it undying?<br>
        And was it never enough?<br>
        Did it hold you when <br>
        You didn’t know <br>
        You needed to be?<br>
        Was it too much to ask for?<br>
        Is it too much to ask for?<br>

    <summary> Impossible </summary>
        <p>
            She said it felt impossible <br>
            And I hung on that very word<br>
            Dug my nails into its hard surface<br>
            rough around the edges, undefined<br>
            It settled on me, heavy<br>
            Despite its hollow center, empty<br>
            <br>
            Impossible was our reality<br>
            Like the house we danced in<br>
            She poured the cement<br>
            And I logged the trees<br>
            Our hands met as we painted the door<br>
            A home.<br>
            <br>
            A home with a wood stove <br>
            That brought me warmth to my core<br>
            Which traveled through each vein in my body<br>
            To my fingertips<br>
            Which, even eyes closed,<br>
            knew exactly where to find her.<br>
<br>
            First to go were the paintings hung on the wall<br>
            I was oblivious to the empty nails<br>
            I watched as she took the storm windows off<br>
            The roof caved in<br>
            I helped as we picked apart the foundation<br>
            And impossible crumbled. <br>

    <summary> The Ocean Ate My Scream</summary>
    <p>
        Last night, I screamed into the ocean <br>
        And the ocean ate it.<br>
        Anger trickled off my lips<br>
        And the waves came and wiped the corners of my mouth. <br>
        Romantic, almost. <br>
        <br>
        The last time the ocean and I met<br>
        It screamed at me<br>
        To lose myself in its expanse<br>
        Only my toes felt its bitter cold then<br>
        And I prayed for the strength to listen. <br>
        <br>
        Yesterday, the ocean and I made our peace.<br>
        I asked it to hold me<br>
        It listened <br>
        My chest felt heavy, but<br>
        The ocean kept me afloat<br>
        It whispered to me<br>
        “let me be your harbor”<br>
        My tears mingled with its salty air<br>
        Heavy breaths ebbed and flowed<br>

        Best Love Song (for alex)
    </summary>
    <p>
        Sing softly, <br>
my dear<br>
And I’ll hold your sound <br>
For your shape next to mine <br>
Is never enough <br>
<br>
Let me search <br>
For hushed tones <br>
Like my hand for yours <br>
I’ll have nothing in exchange<br>
But my tender smile<br>
And a few promises<br>
<br>
Choose our song<br>
<br>
I’ll let your notes<br>
Become<br>
My quiet everything<br>
<br>
And so when you tell me<br>
“This is the best love song ever”<br>
All I ask<br>
Is that you<br>
sing softly<br>
