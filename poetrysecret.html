    <summary> Letter to My Past Life </summary>
    <p>
        I wonder who loved you like that <br>
To make me love like this<br>
What did it feel like,<br>
That senseless joy?<br>
You had to be<br>
the object of hopeful devotion.<br>
Why else am I begging<br>
to be loved like <br>
you must have been?<br>
I am <br>
Ever searching for<br>
What satiated your hunger,<br>
Asking for something too much<br>
And never enough,<br>
Betting my heart <br>
Against all odds <br>
For a love you let me know so <br>
corporeally.<br>

    <summary> Impossible </summary>
        <p>
            She said it felt impossible <br>
            And I hung on that very word<br>
            Dug my nails into its hard surface<br>
            rough around the edges, undefined<br>
            It settled on me, heavy<br>
            Despite its hollow center, empty<br>
            <br>
            Impossible was our reality<br>
            Like the house we danced in<br>
            She poured the cement<br>
            And I logged the trees<br>
            Our hands met as we painted the door<br>
            A home.<br>
            <br>
            A home with a wood stove <br>
            That brought me warmth to my core<br>
            Which traveled through each vein in my body<br>
            To my fingertips<br>
            Which, even eyes closed,<br>
            knew exactly where to find her.<br>
<br>
            First to go were the paintings hung on the wall<br>
            I was oblivious to the empty nails<br>
            I watched as she took the storm windows off<br>
            The roof caved in<br>
            I helped as we picked apart the foundation<br>
            And impossible crumbled. <br>

    <summary> The Ocean Ate My Scream</summary>
    <p>
        Last night, I screamed into the ocean <br>
        And the ocean ate it.<br>
        Anger trickled off my lips<br>
        And the waves came and wiped the corners of my mouth. <br>
        Romantic, almost. <br>
        <br>
        The last time the ocean and I met<br>
        It screamed at me<br>
        To lose myself in its expanse<br>
        Only my toes felt its bitter cold then<br>
        And I prayed for the strength to listen. <br>
        <br>
        Yesterday, the ocean and I made our peace.<br>
        I asked it to hold me<br>
        It listened <br>
        My chest felt heavy, but<br>
        The ocean kept me afloat<br>
        It whispered to me<br>
        “let me be your harbor”<br>
        My tears mingled with its salty air<br>
        Heavy breaths ebbed and flowed<br>

        Best Love Song (for alex)
    </summary>
    <p>
        Sing softly, <br>
my dear<br>
And I’ll hold your sound <br>
For your shape next to mine <br>
Is never enough <br>
<br>
Let me search <br>
For hushed tones <br>
Like my hand for yours <br>
I’ll have nothing in exchange<br>
But my tender smile<br>
And a few promises<br>
<br>
Choose our song<br>
<br>
I’ll let your notes<br>
Become<br>
My quiet everything<br>
<br>
And so when you tell me<br>
“This is the best love song ever”<br>
All I ask<br>
Is that you<br>
sing softly<br>

        Thoughts on a new tattoo
    </summary>
    <p>
        You used to be all knowing <br>
My body danced to the flicks of your fingers<br>
and when you stepped away<br>
My limbs went limp<br>
It felt so safe to be attached to your strings<br>
Every inch yours<br>
To be examined<br>
To be held.<br>
But now you’re gone.<br>
And I’ve learned to walk on my own<br>
Your cords have faded to ink<br>
And I have a new tattoo<br>
That erases a part you knew<br>
And fills my arm <br>
with a thread that’s mine to control<br>
Lines you’ll never know<br>
Beauty you’ll never touch <br>
And I feel buoyant<br>
Knowing that <br>
Your remains are still there<br>
But their knowledge is finite.<br>
My arms exist unbounded by wire<br>
My legs free to wade through the expanse<br>
My beauty unending and always incomplete<br>
Never to be confined by your completed image of me. <br>
I am infinite. <br>

        Altar Candle
    </summary>
    
    
    <p>
        Inhale.<br>
    Breathe as an exchange<br>
    Exhale. <br>
    Breathe towards collective<br>
    Before flame becomes smoke <br>
    becomes what lingers<br>
    Let it be all of us<br>
    Let us linger as the memory of what we’ve built<br>
    You and I are not us, <br>
    Because we do not hold our grief <br>
    alone<br>
    This candle shares in our <br>
    burden<br>
    Which is not ours to <br>
    extinguish <br>
    Yours or mine<br>
    Rather let it revel in what it has become<br>
    As an entity <br>
    Separate from our individuals <br>
    And integral to our union<br>
    Watch it cast its shadow<br>
    Knowing there is more than light <br>
    burning<br>
    Let it be all of us<br>
    Our pain and our joy.<br>
    So In that breath<br>
    Let us burn <br>
    As a means to create. <br>
