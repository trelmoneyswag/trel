        <p>

            Today is the big big day!! I am going to no longer have boobs in literally 12 hours (less even!!) Feeling really nervous abt surgery and recovery. But also feeling like really calm.
This is definitely what I want. I know recovery will be hard. I have definitely felt imposter syndrome, that I am not trans enough! But fuck that!! I am awesome and I am trans and this is beautiful. No boobs is so great.

            June 26 (why is the measure of love loss?)
        </summary>
        <p>

Today is my third day of singledom in a really really long time. 
Today I opened my favorite book (written on the body by Jeanette Winterson) and 
this is the opening line. I think I may embroidery something like this. 
I’m thinking a lot about love, and losing, and loving and losing. 
I also made my bed this morning, and made myself breakfast, and am 
drinking a two-day old latte. There’s something beautiful in the stability.
 I am loving in that I am existing, because I don’t know any other way to exist. 
 I love in my actions and throughout my day. I don’t really feel the need to find myself. 
 I know who I am, I have found comfort in myself especially in the past 2 or so years. I do, 
 however, want to find new ways to love. I want to expand my understanding of love beyond just romance. 
 I have too often viewed myself and my love as too overwhelming to give to people unless 
 they explicitly agree to be romantically involved. No more!!! I’m excited to love 
 my friends deeply and endlessly. I am myself in love and I am also in love with the
 world. How do I recommit myself to that love? How do I commit myself to change?

        I am currently taking a break from my overhaul of this website to blog 
        a little bit. I have been experiencing a lot of joy recently. It is hard for me to be sad mostly 
        because I’m very happy about my recent LIFE ALTERING surgery ;). It’s been so nice to just exist 
        in the past like 12 days with no final boss binder and to take off my shirt whenever the hell I want to!! 
        And also I posted about my top surgery on Instagram and everyone was obsessed with me :) (and also my ex’s
        sister whom I adore and want to be friends with dm’d me from the post, so that was HUGE, winning). 
        I am trying to balance having so many lovely people in my life and that seems like a flex but it is 
        honestly kind of hard because I want to invest in EVERYONE. I also want to invest in myself so I’ve 
        been doing lots of crafting for myself !! I used to only feel creative if I was gift giving, and now 
        I’ve really been enjoying making things for myself and that has been really really awesome. 
        I went out with some friends the other night and have generally been enjoying doing fun and goofy activities.
         I love to be silly!
