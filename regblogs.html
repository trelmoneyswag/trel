        <p>

            Today is the big big day!! I am going to no longer have boobs in literally 12 hours (less even!!) Feeling really nervous abt surgery and recovery. But also feeling like really calm.
This is definitely what I want. I know recovery will be hard. I have definitely felt imposter syndrome, that I am not trans enough! But fuck that!! I am awesome and I am trans and this is beautiful. No boobs is so great.

            June 26 (why is the measure of love loss?)
        </summary>
        <p>

Today is my third day of singledom in a really really long time. 
Today I opened my favorite book (written on the body by Jeanette Winterson) and 
this is the opening line. I think I may embroidery something like this. 
I’m thinking a lot about love, and losing, and loving and losing. 
I also made my bed this morning, and made myself breakfast, and am 
drinking a two-day old latte. There’s something beautiful in the stability.
 I am loving in that I am existing, because I don’t know any other way to exist. 
 I love in my actions and throughout my day. I don’t really feel the need to find myself. 
 I know who I am, I have found comfort in myself especially in the past 2 or so years. I do, 
 however, want to find new ways to love. I want to expand my understanding of love beyond just romance. 
 I have too often viewed myself and my love as too overwhelming to give to people unless 
 they explicitly agree to be romantically involved. No more!!! I’m excited to love 
 my friends deeply and endlessly. I am myself in love and I am also in love with the
 world. How do I recommit myself to that love? How do I commit myself to change?
Thinking about the paradox of serenity. There is nothing serene except for progress 
to me. I do not find serenity in the facade of being untouched. Everything is touched
, and there are bad ways to do this and good ways to do this. I thank romantic partners 
for letting me change and grow and experience the serene. I want to do this with 
everyone, I want to do this by myself.
