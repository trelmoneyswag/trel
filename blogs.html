Wow sorry for abandoning you blog. I was finishing up TWO thesis (one of which I did super duper well on and the other,,, well I passed!!). I am really proud of my history thesis and kind of embarrassed by the other work I did this semester. But what do you want from me!! I did thesis and I WILL be graduating college. 
<br>Also, my granddaddy died today… life is so complicated.  feels weird to be celebrating grad and also grieving. I think that my grad will be a time for family to come together which is nice but also hard bc I’m going to be so distracted. Anyway, I don’t have much to say. I just wanted to blog something because I haven’t in a while and I don’t know what do do about my sadness. I would post on my secret instagram but that feels like a lot and i can’t seem to do it. I just wish everyone in my life would automatically know without me having to say something. I also wish everyone in my life would know what a great guy Granddaddy was. He built my grandmommy a GD BOAT. he was so wonderful and patient and smart and kind. And he was just …. Granddaddy. He was so loved. I will love him forever.

        I am just trying my best to just finish my thesis (+ other thesis). Life is looking up - 
        I just booked a train trip the other week. 3 weeks and several long haul trains!! With 
        my best friend!!! I am sooo excited. Life will be huge and awesome after grad ( I just 
        have to graduate). Also, I am working a summer camp at an arboretum and im frankly just 
        really excited. Today I picked up my books about magical herbs/ herbology (it’s a harry 
        potter world inspired camp) and it will be good. The super secret thing that I am super 
        excited about is that I am trying out a new first name at the camp. #trans it will be 
        awesome and I love the low stakes environment to try and be myself. I pray that people 
        at this camp gender me correctly because they really don’t do that at the school I’m at 
        right now and it makes me very nauseous. 
        Okay this is short because I, again, have to write my thesis (boo again)

        Okay consider this my official post wedding blog…. Not MY wedding god forbid. 
        My beautiful sister got married and that is such a wonderful thing. I always kind of 
        have this thing where weddings are like yeah a little bit over the top and expensive 
        and maybe unnecessary. All probably objectively true, but also when my sister get 
        married NUH UHHH. I am so obsessed with my sister’s wedding because I love my sister. 
        We are truly not that close, but I think this wedding reaffirmed something about family 
        for me. Like yes my sister has closer friends materially, but you can never take away the 
        bond we have literally growing up with each other and the impact she has had on my life. 
        I talked about this on (embarrassing) instagram dot com, but I think my sister made the
         most beautiful bride because she is a) beautiful and b) also a beautiful human being. 
         She has taught me so much about kindness and patience and still is so gracious to me to 
         include me in her love and life even though I was a major brat in my younger life 
         (and maybe a little now). My sister and her now husband have shown me a lot about love. 
         I didn’t want to get into it on instagram dot com. But my mom does this thing and makes 
         me feel really behind, that I’m late on falling in love. It doesn’t make me feel great 
         because I already feel like a failure because I can’t seem to make people love me. Like 
         trust me I’ve tried to have what my sister and her husband have, and it just consistently 
         fails me. And maybe it’ll be different because blah blah blah queerness. But I do what a 
         kind of love that is deep and consistent like they have wouldn’t that be nice. I don’t 
         think I feel jealousy towards my sister though. I am happy she figured it out and I think 
         she gives me hope that I will find love in a way that actually feels good and lasts more 
         than like 6 months. I love to be witness to their love. I also think beyond being an 
         inspiration, my sister and her husband care so much for me, it makes me feel deserving.
          I am so removed from their daily life and yet they make me feel included when it matters 
          and I just think that love like that is what makes me feel like I can be loved in all the
           ways I want to be and that I matter to people. I think there are a lot of nuances to 
           this idea of love and mattering that make my life a little harder, namely queerness and 
           just being a freak, but I learned that I love weddings and 
        that I am loved and that love has my name on it!!

        Okay guys first i apologize for the no blogs in the month of February. 
        I know that must have been devastating.  A lovely instagram commenter reminded me 
        that I should blog about my big win today. Today I won the centennial conference in 
        the high jump!! Woohooo!!! Haven’t done that little thang since freshman year. Was 
        really fun and felt good. I also had a really close attempt at 1.68 which would have 
        meant really big things, but that’s okay bc i think i will get it again. Hopefully. 
        Hopefully one day soon!! It also just feels really nice because truly I have put a 
        lot of work into this freaking sport over the past year and I am finally starting to
         see it pay off. Like in a serious way this makes me feel like I am capable of a lot 
         of things. It is just good to try really hard and do really well and be able to say yay! 
         I am awesome! And I deserve good things. I also just realized that the last blog was also
          about track, but that’s okay - I will certainly blog about other things soon. But perhaps 
          not for 
        now because I have to go write a thesis (boo)

I am sitting in a cafe while my friend works. I am not really thinking about much, 
but I recently made some stamps and stamped some old stationary from my basement. 
I’m writing letters to my friends! I love snail mail and if you’re reading this you 
should send me some snail mail. I think there’s something really beautiful about being
 intentional about words and having a break from regular texting. I don’t kind words hit 
 as hard over text. And sometimes they are mistimed and then they disappear. Something 
 concrete like a letter is really comforting. It feels like a manifestation of my love. 
 Do you know how much I love you? Well now you can hold it in your hand. You can read it 
 over and over again and find comfort in my words. You can also let it disappear and hopefully 
 it will come back to you maybe when you needed to know you are soo loved. I hope to tell all 
 my friends this year how much I love them. My New Years Resolutions are as follows: 
 Read more, sleep solidly, and love deeply. Also maybe to remain single for the calendar, 
 but who knows ! I won’t close myself off to romantic love if it really hits me in the face, 
 but I sure as hell am not gonna search for it. I want to love deeply to the people around me, 
 the second half of the year felt great because I got so comfortable being alone, 
 but now I want to make sure I’m reminding my friends that they are the best!!

        On the train to school to start early return and then to start 
        literally my last semester of college! What ! this is crazytown. 
        I truly cannot believe that this is happening to me. The ever marching 
        passage of time is one wild thing. I am thinking a lot about who I want 
        to be post grad and what life is going to look like when I don’t have the 
        structure of school. But also I am not! I am just thinking about reaping the 
        benefits of all my hardwork to make this last semester the best ever. I am hoping 
        to have a rockin birthday party. An AWESOME social life. Some thesis work that 
        I am proud of. Etc etc okay blog out im bored

            Sooooo I set the school record !!! Twice in one day !! no biggie! 
            Except sort of biggie. But also my coach says I have to hashtag stay 
            greedy. What a beautiful sentiment. Hopefully there is still more to come, 
            hopefully i jump higher. The secret is, blog, and I suppose not a secret because 
            I’m writing it here- is that I want to jump higher. There are things I can only do 
            if I jump higher… 1.66 is not enough. But also it is really a beautiful thing that 
            after working really really hard since I came back from surgery in July. I said you 
            know what!! Sucking at track is NO fun. So I said let me lock the fuck in. and i did 
            my plyos and i did my lifts (I didn’t really run but who care). And now I have a taper 
            to look forward to… I am really quite excited and trying to hold myself to a higher 
            standard. Looking to do great things and at least have #no regrets. Need to stay healthy.
             I want to be proud of myself and prove to myself that I can do things when I try hard!! 
             It is worth trying!! It is also worth failing. Bc I would rather give me all for these 
             last few months.

            Okay sorry that finals got my ass in a serious way… only blog for december, 
            but I’m going to try and make it worth your while (maybe). 
<br>
<br>
            I had a really exhausting end of the semester and I am almost proud of all
             of the work that I submitted. I am really excited to have ⅔ of my credits 
             next semester be passion projects. I also am so so so proud of my relationships.
              I really really love my friends. And I just felt even when I was so alone during 
              finals week, just really secure in my relationships and all the beauty they have 
              brought into my life. I also had great family time and it was hard bc gender, as
               it always is, but it was also really really nice to be with people who I see myself
                in. I am glad to have today to rest and recharge. <br>
                <br>
            
            [super personal-romantic gush ahead]<br>
            I did my semesterly scrapbook today. Last night I showed my scrapbook to 
            two of my friends and I was a little embarrassed that I had like two pages 
            dedicated to an ex throughout the scrapbook. But then this morning when I went 
            through my scrapbook again, I read the letters that made up the second page. I didn’t
             feel embarrassed at all which has been a really primary emotion I have been feeling 
             about this particular ex. Instead, I felt really grateful, maybe it wasn’t so terrible
              to learn new things about myself and to try and give my love to someone even though
               it was hard and I was really not in a place to do that. It felt good to read kind
                words from someone I cared a lot about (and still do!) and it made me feel like 
                maybe it doesn’t have to be all bad. Like yeah the relationship was far from great
                 and I am not proud of how I acted, but also maybe I was deserving of care and 
                 affection and maybe I made someone happy, even if I doubt I make her happy now. 
                 I think that can be worth it. I think that no matter how hard and far from perfect
                  it was, that it was worth it, because affection can be so transformative. 
                  I thought I would take out one of those pages, but instead I went back to my
                   tiny purple bag of hidden notes from another ex, and added another page around
                    her time. If one ex gets two pages, certainly it is worth it to give the ex 
                    that really changed my life a little more air time. I am so glad that I am 
                    single because I get all this time to process the way that love has impacted
                     me. And I know that I want all love to be important to me and it is, but I 
                     do think there is something about romantic love that I don’t want to hide 
                     as a big part of why I am the way I am. I decided to add some personal mementos
                      from my first love in the scrapbook because I am not hurting anymore and 
                      I’m not embarrassed to have loved and lost because the love was so important
                       to me. I think that next time people go through my scrapbook 
                       I will be really proud to have been loved and to have loved and that 
                       romantic love doesn’t have to be hidden just because it goes away.

            <p> Wow year end blog maybe (just so there’s not only one super personal one 
              in december). I think this year was a really great year overall. Of course 
              there were some lows, as is life. But life is so sweet, divas. I think this 
              year let me slow down. I did not feel so rushed. This past semester I made my 
              bed every morning, I stretched every night. I stopped jaywalking in a rush if 
              there was no rush, and I let myself feel a lot of feelings. I am grateful for 
              the opportunity to be slow and to move with care. I am so grateful to my support 
              system and to myself for being brave because now i have literally 0 boobs. 
              Sometimes i forget that I ever had boobs!! What a big year. I am so proud of 
              myself for beating like 60% of my friends bets and being single for so long and 
              no plans to change that. Those are two really big things.  I am so happy to have 
              had so many friends prove themselves to be exactly who I thought they were 
              (lovely and kind people). I am so blessed in so many facets. I think this year 
              was a big one for growth and stepping into myself. I am very cool and I am kind 
              and I am worthy of love. Sometimes the rat in my brain tries to say otherwise. 
              This year the muzzle on the rat was muzzling (!!) I I am really in awe of who I 
              am becoming and I hope 2025 brings an even stronger commitment to the people and 
              things that I care about. I love to love ! God its such a beautiful thing. 
              Also super thankful for this website for holding my thoughts and projects 
              because someone gotta do it!

      I fall off on these blogs all the time, sorry to the culture, sorry to the people. I’ve obviously been feeling very bleak,
       but also i want to blog about track. I have missed a lot of track because of my quad and then also i’ve been sick!! I feel 
       the impending end of my track career heavy every time I miss a practice or get injured. Terrible! But I just am so grateful 
       to have had this beautiful thing that has taught me so much about myself and given me maybe a few too many life lessons. I’m 
       trying to really savor the last year of this because I want to give it all. 
      Leave it all on the pit!! okay short blog but its 7am so I’ll try and blog more than once a month.

      Good evening, beautiful evening. What a day to be alive. Yesterday I watched 
      Hamilton the musical live in the great city of Philadelphia. I am here to report 
      that I DID in fact cry at the sad parts. When Eliza was burning those letters and 
      the son died. Like damn being confronted with love and trust lost and mortality in 
      song is really hard. I also just cry everytime I see live theater because I truly 
      just think its so beautiful that people are so talented and can sing with such emotion.
       Like that is actually just one of the most spectacular things ever. And I got to see 
       it with my best friends who I love so dearly. People don’t really get platonic intimacy
        these days I think. Like why can’t I love my friends with passion and fervor?? This is 
        now a tangent but i think it is worth going on about because truly I am just so in love
         with my friends and I think that is so beautiful and it actually pisses me off when 
         ppl think i am dating them. CANT A GUY LOVE ???

        I love to blog these days mostly because I am procrastinating!!! Today on my blog
         I am thinking about the fact that Angela Davis came to our freaking school. And 
         that i get to eat a “large lunch” with her too. The lord is good!!! I loved the 
         talk and I didn’t fall asleep during it (take that “narcolepsy”!!!) I feel like there’s 
         so much for me to learn and I think that I really appreciated the takes that she had 
         around what it means to organize. I feel frustrated when people look to big scholars 
         and activists and expect them to hold their hand and say here is what you need to do. 
         I heard a little bit of that reaction from some people. That they wanted Davis to explain
          to them how they can organize. I think the tricky thing is that she did tell them. 
          She didn’t have the answers in the way of well if you plan a protest at this day and 
          time you’ll win. But she said that you have to be in it, you have to do what you can, 
          you have to think in collective terms and understand the various different approaches 
          to activism. There is so much more than being in the streets (although that’s important).
           I think its wrong to look to elders for all the answers, because if they had it we would
            have won by now. NOT TO SAY they don’t have wisdom of course they do!! We need to learn
             all we can fromthem but also apply it to our 
        changing context and learn from ourselves too. Thank you angela davis.

            Almost fall break lets go!!! I don’t have anything in particular I want to say on this blessed site 
            but I want to just see what comes out of my brain for this blog. I mostly am super into my research 
            project for my history capstone. It is actually a little bit wild that I have finally caught the academia 
            bug (not too much tho, I still didn’t apply for a fucking Fulbright or the Watson). I am writing about 
            community responses to AIDS in Philadelphia in the 1980s and 1990s and I don’t even know what my argument
             is going to be!! But goddang I love going to the archives and learning literally everything I can about 
             the topic. It is actually so awesome to think about and read about. I LOVE LEARNING. I am lowkey trying 
             to extend it to a thesis (Ed department chair if you are reading this please please please let me do it 
             and still get certified). Wouldn’t that be awesome?? Just a paper I can be super proud of ??? GOD I WISH. 
             I have to start writing soon, THAT’S REALLY SCARY THO. I want to do a good job because I think I could 
             learn a lot and maybe I could have others read and learn a lot. I want to be a teacher sooo bad let me 
             learn in a chill way!!!

            Today I blog about pretty much nothing, but I’m sitting in class and I am very bored. So a life 
            update is that i giggle a lot with my friends, i do lots of reading. I am starting to develop some
             serious frontal lobe development. I make my bed in the morning and i dont go on my phone before bed.
              It is helping a lot i think. I really have been feeling some rage recently which famously is a deadly sin. 
              So that’s an awful feeling. When will i be free from wrath???? This is crazy. But also im super locked into 
              the joys of life. I am loving leading the track team. It feels really right. People also keep telling me im 
              mature which feels crazy to hear but really good. Maybe im awesome???? Maybe im soooo cool and ppl like me and 
              respect me??? I LOVE validation. 
            That is my life idk blog. Maybe one day i will say something profound

            I am at work and am sooo bored and didn’t bring my readings for capstone so unfortunately I have nothing 
            to do but blog! Which is a good thing because I like to blog (sometimes). I am feeling very busy but in a 
            really good way. (sometimes overwhelming). If only I didn’t have to take POLS 003 this semester I would be 
            sooo awesome and free. Looking forward to 3 credits next semester. <br>
            Today I have been thinking a lot about bad friends. Not because I have friends 
            who are bad people, but because I think it's an interesting concept to think about how 
            friends fluctuate. I think it's okay to admit that people are being bad friends or that you yourself 
            are being a bad friend. Like it's okay to prioritize things that are not one particular friendship, 
            but that does make you a bad friend at that moment. I wish people would admit that more often. It doesn’t 
            make you a bad person to be a bad friend, but not being there for a friend makes you a bad friend. Bc there
             might be the qualifier “bad” but ultimately there is still “friend” and that’s nice. And it sucks when
              people get defensive because we are obsessed with the idea of being good all the time. That’s actually 
              just not how being human works. We are good and sometimes bad and that is fine. Literally it’s fine. If 
              you can accept that you are being a bad friend or made a mistake then maybe you can work to fix it, but 
              if you give yourself excuses to placate yourself you will just be being a bad friend for as long as it's 
              convenient for you. And then you’re veering into selfish territory and i really dont fux with that. Anyway
               idk if that made sense. But there you go blog

            So apparently the family reunion was just covid fest so now I’m dealing with that. 
            I am always surprised with how much i like my family. They have plenty of their flaws and
            im sure if we talked politics i would really not enjoy their presence and I think that is a lot o
            f privilege in that sentence. And i’m convinced that most of them i could radicalize if i had more 
            time. They are just all very invested in family and collective care, we just have to get them to extend 
            some more compassion elsewhere. But people were sooo good about not deadnaming me. And ppl used the wrong
             pronouns for me occasionally but it was okay!!! I love to be affirmed. Also, white water rafting was 
             awesome and all around the whole trip reinvigorated my passion for the great outdoors. I want to do 
             outdoorsy jobs in the summer!!1

              Hi blog! I haven’t blogged in a while because I have been sadly without my computer 
              for a while. Not for any reason other than I don’t want to travel with it. I had an 
              interesting time with the org I was interning with and that’s literally all I want to 
              say about it. I have had such a wonderful time with my grandparents and great aunts. I
               spend lots of time with grandmommy and she is so sweet and cute. One of my great aunts 
               who was a professional chef let me cook with her and practice my chopping skills. That was
                awesome. And then the other one who is a professional artist helped me watercolor some 
                tangerines, see the watercolor section for that bad boy (definitely one of my best). 
                I have so much to learn from the older folks in my life. However this also a sad 
                undertone in the visit because my granddaddy is really struggling. He walks slowly behind us,
                 he can only whisper to talk (my grandmommy is hard of hearing so thats a struggle too), and 
                 overall he is just not who I grew up with. I think it's really hard on my Grandmommy because 
                 she is losing the love of her life so slowly. That’s really got me emotional because wow it 
                 really all does slip away from you in one way or another. But I also see them remembering and 
                 telling me about their life over the years. Trying my best to remember it all or at least to 
                 remember enough to let it inform me and how I move through the world. Anyway this has been the
                  perfect end to the summer because it reminded me how much I have to look forward to in life and
                   also just yay it was fun. #blogout

            <p>    I am currently taking a break from my overhaul of this website to blog 
                a little bit. I have been experiencing a lot of joy recently. It is hard for me to be sad mostly 
                because I’m very happy about my recent LIFE ALTERING surgery ;). It’s been so nice to just exist 
                in the past like 12 days with no final boss binder and to take off my shirt whenever the hell I want to!! 
                And also I posted about my top surgery on Instagram and everyone was obsessed with me :)  
                I am trying to balance having so many lovely people in my life and that seems like a flex but it is 
                honestly kind of hard because I want to invest in EVERYONE. I also want to invest in myself so I’ve 
                been doing lots of crafting for myself !! I used to only feel creative if I was gift giving, and now 
                I’ve really been enjoying making things for myself and that has been really really awesome. 
                I went out with some friends the other night and have generally been enjoying doing fun and goofy activities.
                 I love to be silly!

          <p>  Woah! Two blogs in the same week?? Unheard of from trelly. A new era mayhaps??? Today I’ve been 
            thinking a lot about a lot of things and mostly how I feel really proud of myself for all of my growth. 
            Without getting into too much detail because you never know where the ops are, I have done a lot of things 
            in the past few days that when truly 3 years ago I would have been on the floor paralyzed by anxiety. Maybe 
            it's my meds!!! Probably a little the meds, but also a lot of a bit about me. And my ability to manage my 
            emotions and do what needs to be done. I am speaking up for myself and asking for what I need. That’s so 
            beautiful. It’s been making me a little sad though, because I do have a lot of people that I wish could see
             my growth. Almost all are people who are still alive and well, they just aren’t in my life anymore. Some 
             of the people are out of spite, you know the people who have wronged me, and I want them to see me up. And
              some of the people are just people who didn’t fit and I want to share my joy with them. I wish everyone I
               ever loved could be in my pocket at all times. Loving and losing is a theme here isn’t it. I think that
                acute feeling is so accentuated by this weird compiling of not being over my first love and also going
                 through an emotionally complicated breakup just over a year later. 
            I also am scared to grow a little bit. Because there are a lot of ways that I want to grow more, especially
             in regards to my queer and transness. And that is really too scary to talk about actually. Okay good bye blog!!

          On Tuesday, I had a really long call with my org. Thinking about how I’ve changed my relationship 
          with organizing. I really want to be a good organizer, and my boss said something about how relationships 
          are important in organizing. Not just knowing people in your organization, but having people who would be 
          willing to sacrifice for your survival. I think one of my barriers to real real organizing is that I feel
           like I have people who would have my back no matter what. I have built such a good community of friends that
           I am not searching, I know I have to ground myself in a political community though, I really need to find that
            somewhere, I just am really struggling to find it. I hoped that this summer org would do it for me, but sadly 
            I don’t think this org is my political home. I hope that i’ll find it through teaching. So maybe another year,
             although time feels like it is increasingly pressing. 
          In the time, I will learn how to take care of plants, nurture ish.

          I am on a plane and I am deciding to blog a little bit because Silly Philly Summer coming to an end!! 
          What the heck!!! It was awesome truly. Like Guatemala was a great summer, but it didn’t feel like SUMMER.
          So this is the best summer I’ve had I think think think think. Mostly because I actually am just in love 
          with my friends and felt really loved allll summer long. Shoutout my roommates for just really getting to a
           new level in our relationship. I think they really helped make it what it was, because I just felt really 
           close to both of them. I am sad to be leaving, but I think August will bring lots of new stories. And first,
            a family reunion!! I think I am going to be so incredibly vague on this blog, but I like having a place to 
            think through thoughts and make them semi- ready
           for public consumption even though I don’t think very many people will read these.

            <p>   Today is the big big day!! I am going to no longer have boobs in literally 12 hours (less even!!) Feeling really nervous abt surgery and recovery. But also feeling like really calm.
                This is definitely what I want. I know recovery will be hard. I have definitely felt imposter syndrome, that I am not trans enough! But fuck that!! I am awesome and I am trans and this is beautiful. No boobs is so great.

              why is the measure of love loss
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>   Today is my third day of singledom in a really really long time. 
                Today I opened my favorite book (written on the body by Jeanette Winterson) and 
                this is the opening line. I think I may embroidery something like this. 
                I’m thinking a lot about love, and losing, and loving and losing. 
                I also made my bed this morning, and made myself breakfast, and am 
                drinking a two-day old latte. There’s something beautiful in the stability.
                 I am loving in that I am existing, because I don’t know any other way to exist. 
                 I love in my actions and throughout my day. I don’t really feel the need to find myself. 
                 I know who I am, I have found comfort in myself especially in the past 2 or so years. I do, 
                 however, want to find new ways to love. I want to expand my understanding of love beyond just romance. 
                 I have too often viewed myself and my love as too overwhelming to give to people unless 
                 they explicitly agree to be romantically involved. No more!!! I’m excited to love 
                 my friends deeply and endlessly. I am myself in love and I am also in love with the
                 world. How do I recommit myself to that love? How do I commit myself to change?

      <p>
         Today was the election in Guatemala and I also couldn’t 
         really move because I sprained my ankle at basketball 
         yesterday. Feeling a mix of abundance and isolation at the 
         same time. I am also feeling lucky to be a part of 
         history in Guatemala and also I felt a little disconnected 
         from the space and the celebrations. It’s weird knowing tha
         t I’ll only be here for 4 more months.

      <summary> Oct 8</summary>
      <p>

My reflections on the past month and a half:
I felt weird being back in the states and feel weird being here. I am increasingly feeling like 6 months is not enough time here. I am just starting to get to know what this works and getting to a point where I feel useful and am really enjoying myself. At the same time, I feel my college experience and friends are ever so fleeting. I love so many of you and a lot of you will graduate in like 8 months?? WHAT?? and then in a year and 8 months I GRADUATE??? I feel so bad missing treasured time where I could live within a walking distance of so many of my loved ones. But also I think I'll feel so much guilt leaving here. How can I know so much about struggle in Guatemala and build relationships and then just leave. I find comfort in two things: 1) Knowing that there will be community of Former Acos (my job) in philly that I can maintain solidarity networks with and 2) feeling small! This may seem weird because I tend to take up a lot of space in my relationships with you all! and I am quite Tall. However, I find peace in being small in my organizing. I don't want to be big. I am not going to fix anything by myself. I want to be small. And I want to be in community with other people, and I want us to all stand so close that from above we look very big and scary. I am a small part of a huge decades long organizing effort in Guatemala. That is beautiful. When I am gone, someone else will take my place, but they will be informed by me. and hopefully on the ground I can be big to some people (I am Tall). 
I also am worried about the Guatemala political context that I shared. I know that I exist in privilege in this space and that makes me removed from the struggle. There are boundaries on where and how I can support and those are tricky to navigate. I want to be all in, but sometimes I'm not I can be within the parameters of my role as an accompanier.
I also miss all of you and being back was so nice and a taste of what I am missing. But, after not seeing anyone over the summer I know that my relationships with you await my return and that they will pick up where they left off and I'm excited to have many hugs and laughs and even maybe a giggle.
