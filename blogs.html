      I fall off on these blogs all the time, sorry to the culture, sorry to the people. I’ve obviously been feeling very bleak,
       but also i want to blog about track. I have missed a lot of track because of my quad and then also i’ve been sick!! I feel 
       the impending end of my track career heavy every time I miss a practice or get injured. Terrible! But I just am so grateful 
       to have had this beautiful thing that has taught me so much about myself and given me maybe a few too many life lessons. I’m 
       trying to really savor the last year of this because I want to give it all. 
      Leave it all on the pit!! okay short blog but its 7am so I’ll try and blog more than once a month.

            Almost fall break lets go!!! I don’t have anything in particular I want to say on this blessed site 
            but I want to just see what comes out of my brain for this blog. I mostly am super into my research 
            project for my history capstone. It is actually a little bit wild that I have finally caught the academia 
            bug (not too much tho, I still didn’t apply for a fucking Fulbright or the Watson). I am writing about 
            community responses to AIDS in Philadelphia in the 1980s and 1990s and I don’t even know what my argument
             is going to be!! But goddang I love going to the archives and learning literally everything I can about 
             the topic. It is actually so awesome to think about and read about. I LOVE LEARNING. I am lowkey trying 
             to extend it to a thesis (Ed department chair if you are reading this please please please let me do it 
             and still get certified). Wouldn’t that be awesome?? Just a paper I can be super proud of ??? GOD I WISH. 
             I have to start writing soon, THAT’S REALLY SCARY THO. I want to do a good job because I think I could 
             learn a lot and maybe I could have others read and learn a lot. I want to be a teacher sooo bad let me 
             learn in a chill way!!!

            Today I blog about pretty much nothing, but I’m sitting in class and I am very bored. So a life 
            update is that i giggle a lot with my friends, i do lots of reading. I am starting to develop some
             serious frontal lobe development. I make my bed in the morning and i dont go on my phone before bed.
              It is helping a lot i think. I really have been feeling some rage recently which famously is a deadly sin. 
              So that’s an awful feeling. When will i be free from wrath???? This is crazy. But also im super locked into 
              the joys of life. I am loving leading the track team. It feels really right. People also keep telling me im 
              mature which feels crazy to hear but really good. Maybe im awesome???? Maybe im soooo cool and ppl like me and 
              respect me??? I LOVE validation. 
            That is my life idk blog. Maybe one day i will say something profound

            I am at work and am sooo bored and didn’t bring my readings for capstone so unfortunately I have nothing 
            to do but blog! Which is a good thing because I like to blog (sometimes). I am feeling very busy but in a 
            really good way. (sometimes overwhelming). If only I didn’t have to take POLS 003 this semester I would be 
            sooo awesome and free. Looking forward to 3 credits next semester. <br>
            Today I have been thinking a lot about bad friends. Not because I have friends 
            who are bad people, but because I think it's an interesting concept to think about how 
            friends fluctuate. I think it's okay to admit that people are being bad friends or that you yourself 
            are being a bad friend. Like it's okay to prioritize things that are not one particular friendship, 
            but that does make you a bad friend at that moment. I wish people would admit that more often. It doesn’t 
            make you a bad person to be a bad friend, but not being there for a friend makes you a bad friend. Bc there
             might be the qualifier “bad” but ultimately there is still “friend” and that’s nice. And it sucks when
              people get defensive because we are obsessed with the idea of being good all the time. That’s actually 
              just not how being human works. We are good and sometimes bad and that is fine. Literally it’s fine. If 
              you can accept that you are being a bad friend or made a mistake then maybe you can work to fix it, but 
              if you give yourself excuses to placate yourself you will just be being a bad friend for as long as it's 
              convenient for you. And then you’re veering into selfish territory and i really dont fux with that. Anyway
               idk if that made sense. But there you go blog

            So apparently the family reunion was just covid fest so now I’m dealing with that. 
            I am always surprised with how much i like my family. They have plenty of their flaws and
            im sure if we talked politics i would really not enjoy their presence and I think that is a lot o
            f privilege in that sentence. And i’m convinced that most of them i could radicalize if i had more 
            time. They are just all very invested in family and collective care, we just have to get them to extend 
            some more compassion elsewhere. But people were sooo good about not deadnaming me. And ppl used the wrong
             pronouns for me occasionally but it was okay!!! I love to be affirmed. Also, white water rafting was 
             awesome and all around the whole trip reinvigorated my passion for the great outdoors. I want to do 
             outdoorsy jobs in the summer!!1

            <p>  
              Hi blog! I haven’t blogged in a while because I have been sadly without my computer 
              for a while. Not for any reason other than I don’t want to travel with it. I had an 
              interesting time with the org I was interning with and that’s literally all I want to 
              say about it. I have had such a wonderful time with my grandparents and great aunts. I
               spend lots of time with grandmommy and she is so sweet and cute. One of my great aunts 
               who was a professional chef let me cook with her and practice my chopping skills. That was
                awesome. And then the other one who is a professional artist helped me watercolor some 
                tangerines, see the watercolor section for that bad boy (definitely one of my best). 
                I have so much to learn from the older folks in my life. However this also a sad 
                undertone in the visit because my granddaddy is really struggling. He walks slowly behind us,
                 he can only whisper to talk (my grandmommy is hard of hearing so thats a struggle too), and 
                 overall he is just not who I grew up with. I think it's really hard on my Grandmommy because 
                 she is losing the love of her life so slowly. That’s really got me emotional because wow it 
                 really all does slip away from you in one way or another. But I also see them remembering and 
                 telling me about their life over the years. Trying my best to remember it all or at least to 
                 remember enough to let it inform me and how I move through the world. Anyway this has been the
                  perfect end to the summer because it reminded me how much I have to look forward to in life and
                   also just yay it was fun. #blogout

            <p>    I am currently taking a break from my overhaul of this website to blog 
                a little bit. I have been experiencing a lot of joy recently. It is hard for me to be sad mostly 
                because I’m very happy about my recent LIFE ALTERING surgery ;). It’s been so nice to just exist 
                in the past like 12 days with no final boss binder and to take off my shirt whenever the hell I want to!! 
                And also I posted about my top surgery on Instagram and everyone was obsessed with me :) (and also my ex’s
                sister whom I adore and want to be friends with dm’d me from the post, so that was HUGE, winning). 
                I am trying to balance having so many lovely people in my life and that seems like a flex but it is 
                honestly kind of hard because I want to invest in EVERYONE. I also want to invest in myself so I’ve 
                been doing lots of crafting for myself !! I used to only feel creative if I was gift giving, and now 
                I’ve really been enjoying making things for myself and that has been really really awesome. 
                I went out with some friends the other night and have generally been enjoying doing fun and goofy activities.
                 I love to be silly!

          <p>  Woah! Two blogs in the same week?? Unheard of from trelly. A new era mayhaps??? Today I’ve been 
            thinking a lot about a lot of things and mostly how I feel really proud of myself for all of my growth. 
            Without getting into too much detail because you never know where the ops are, I have done a lot of things 
            in the past few days that when truly 3 years ago I would have been on the floor paralyzed by anxiety. Maybe 
            it's my meds!!! Probably a little the meds, but also a lot of a bit about me. And my ability to manage my 
            emotions and do what needs to be done. I am speaking up for myself and asking for what I need. That’s so 
            beautiful. It’s been making me a little sad though, because I do have a lot of people that I wish could see
             my growth. Almost all are people who are still alive and well, they just aren’t in my life anymore. Some 
             of the people are out of spite, you know the people who have wronged me, and I want them to see me up. And
              some of the people are just people who didn’t fit and I want to share my joy with them. I wish everyone I
               ever loved could be in my pocket at all times. Loving and losing is a theme here isn’t it. I think that
                acute feeling is so accentuated by this weird compiling of not being over my first love and also going
                 through an emotionally complicated breakup just over a year later. 
            I also am scared to grow a little bit. Because there are a lot of ways that I want to grow more, especially
             in regards to my queer and transness. And that is really too scary to talk about actually. Okay good bye blog!!

          On Tuesday, I had a really long call with my org. Thinking about how I’ve changed my relationship 
          with organizing. I really want to be a good organizer, and my boss said something about how relationships 
          are important in organizing. Not just knowing people in your organization, but having people who would be 
          willing to sacrifice for your survival. I think one of my barriers to real real organizing is that I feel
           like I have people who would have my back no matter what. I have built such a good community of friends that
           I am not searching, I know I have to ground myself in a political community though, I really need to find that
            somewhere, I just am really struggling to find it. I hoped that this summer org would do it for me, but sadly 
            I don’t think this org is my political home. I hope that i’ll find it through teaching. So maybe another year,
             although time feels like it is increasingly pressing. 
          In the time, I will learn how to take care of plants, nurture ish.

          I am on a plane and I am deciding to blog a little bit because Silly Philly Summer coming to an end!! 
          What the heck!!! It was awesome truly. Like Guatemala was a great summer, but it didn’t feel like SUMMER.
          So this is the best summer I’ve had I think think think think. Mostly because I actually am just in love 
          with my friends and felt really loved allll summer long. Shoutout my roommates for just really getting to a
           new level in our relationship. I think they really helped make it what it was, because I just felt really 
           close to both of them. I am sad to be leaving, but I think August will bring lots of new stories. And first,
            a family reunion!! I think I am going to be so incredibly vague on this blog, but I like having a place to 
            think through thoughts and make them semi- ready
           for public consumption even though I don’t think very many people will read these.

            <p>   Today is the big big day!! I am going to no longer have boobs in literally 12 hours (less even!!) Feeling really nervous abt surgery and recovery. But also feeling like really calm.
                This is definitely what I want. I know recovery will be hard. I have definitely felt imposter syndrome, that I am not trans enough! But fuck that!! I am awesome and I am trans and this is beautiful. No boobs is so great.

              why is the measure of love loss
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>   Today is my third day of singledom in a really really long time. 
                Today I opened my favorite book (written on the body by Jeanette Winterson) and 
                this is the opening line. I think I may embroidery something like this. 
                I’m thinking a lot about love, and losing, and loving and losing. 
                I also made my bed this morning, and made myself breakfast, and am 
                drinking a two-day old latte. There’s something beautiful in the stability.
                 I am loving in that I am existing, because I don’t know any other way to exist. 
                 I love in my actions and throughout my day. I don’t really feel the need to find myself. 
                 I know who I am, I have found comfort in myself especially in the past 2 or so years. I do, 
                 however, want to find new ways to love. I want to expand my understanding of love beyond just romance. 
                 I have too often viewed myself and my love as too overwhelming to give to people unless 
                 they explicitly agree to be romantically involved. No more!!! I’m excited to love 
                 my friends deeply and endlessly. I am myself in love and I am also in love with the
                 world. How do I recommit myself to that love? How do I commit myself to change?

      <p>
         Today was the election in Guatemala and I also couldn’t 
         really move because I sprained my ankle at basketball 
         yesterday. Feeling a mix of abundance and isolation at the 
         same time. I am also feeling lucky to be a part of 
         history in Guatemala and also I felt a little disconnected 
         from the space and the celebrations. It’s weird knowing tha
         t I’ll only be here for 4 more months.

      <p>

My reflections on the past month and a half:
I felt weird being back in the states and feel weird being here. I am increasingly feeling like 6 months is not enough time here. I am just starting to get to know what this works and getting to a point where I feel useful and am really enjoying myself. At the same time, I feel my college experience and friends are ever so fleeting. I love so many of you and a lot of you will graduate in like 8 months?? WHAT?? and then in a year and 8 months I GRADUATE??? I feel so bad missing treasured time where I could live within a walking distance of so many of my loved ones. But also I think I'll feel so much guilt leaving here. How can I know so much about struggle in Guatemala and build relationships and then just leave. I find comfort in two things: 1) Knowing that there will be community of Former Acos (my job) in philly that I can maintain solidarity networks with and 2) feeling small! This may seem weird because I tend to take up a lot of space in my relationships with you all! and I am quite Tall. However, I find peace in being small in my organizing. I don't want to be big. I am not going to fix anything by myself. I want to be small. And I want to be in community with other people, and I want us to all stand so close that from above we look very big and scary. I am a small part of a huge decades long organizing effort in Guatemala. That is beautiful. When I am gone, someone else will take my place, but they will be informed by me. and hopefully on the ground I can be big to some people (I am Tall). 
I also am worried about the Guatemala political context that I shared. I know that I exist in privilege in this space and that makes me removed from the struggle. There are boundaries on where and how I can support and those are tricky to navigate. I want to be all in, but sometimes I'm not I can be within the parameters of my role as an accompanier.
I also miss all of you and being back was so nice and a taste of what I am missing. But, after not seeing anyone over the summer I know that my relationships with you await my return and that they will pick up where they left off and I'm excited to have many hugs and laughs and even maybe a giggle.
