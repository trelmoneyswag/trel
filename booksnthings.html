                <summary>Written on the Body by Jeanette Winterson</summary>
                <img src="images/writtenonthebody.jpeg">
                <p>This book is quite possible and probably my favorite book 
                    that I have ever read. I love it so much because it’s like
                     so corny and cliche but that’s kind of the whole point. 
                     I have been wanting to write down my thoughts on this book
                      for a minute. I really appreciate this book because it 
                      honestly just made me think about love in super 
                      interesting ways. When I tell people about this book I say 
                      that I read it when I was falling in love for the first time and 
                      it resonated so deeply with me. The irrationality of love is
                       depicted brilliantly. I think I have an affinity for 
                       hyperbolic depictions of emotions because that’s honestly how
                        I feel. I am a dramatic mothereffer so when Winterson describes 
                        this ridiculous way of experiencing love that is all consuming, 
                        I FELT that. The book is half about falling in love and half 
                        about loss. What it feels like to grieve a partner. The first
                         time I read it felt thrilling, to know that what I was
                          risking was epic and intense. The second (well technically
                           third) time I read it, I was actively experiencing this 
                           sense of loss. I think that it complicated the reading a 
                           lot. I think that Winterson plays with what it feels like
                            to feel loss in your body. That love and loss are corporeal
                             experiences. It hurts to love and it hurts to lose. Those
                              are embodied sensations, ones that you often share in 
                              love and are ripped apart from during loss.I don’t want 
                              to spoil the ending too much in case you want to read it
                              , but I think that it offers a grounding to me that intensity 
                              settles. Whether its love or whether its loss, I find comfort 
                              in this depiction that I won’t have to exist in cliches for 
                              the rest of my life. I just love the way Winterson plays with 
                              these cliches and their existence. In one way validating them 
                              and in another making it clear that the language that is classically
                               and poetically associated with love is a little ridiculous. 
                               I don’t honestly think that this makes sense without having 
                               read the book, so you should read it and let’s talk about it! </p>

              <summary> Insecure (HBO show by Issa Rae)</summary>
              <p>
                I just finished this series. It was spectacular. A rare win for Trel watching good television. 
                I was always a little shocked by the raw sex scenes but other than that I have no notes. 
                I think Issa Rae does a great job of just being like yeah life is real and it can be super 
                awkward. Very few shows do that for me. Like I get you Issa, it’s hard and so weird.
                 I really appreciated that aspect of the series. When I hadn’t heard of this show but
                  people were talking about it, they were always talking about the love triangle at the end.
                   HOMIES WHAT LOVE TRIANGLE??? Like Nathan was never that serious for me. I think maybe if 
                   I watch it again I’ll see more of Lawrence’s flaws. But honestly I don’t see themmmm. 
                   Like yeah he’s imperfect and gets chlamydia, but I think he treated the original break up 
                   with respect. Like yeah he’s not gonna stay after he gets cheated on. I’m soooo 
                   anti-cheating but that’s just me. He just seems like a good guy and clearly he and
                    Issa have such good chemistry. And that good like could be friends too chemistry 
                    which is more than what you can say about Nathan. 
        
               <br> Every time Molly and Issa fought it actually made the show deeply hard to watch. 
               Like i love their friendship so bad. Like that’s real stuff. I love them and I was more
                invested in them than I was in either of their relationships. Literally just no way. 
                Each of them fucked up but its like forgive and forgettttttt. 
                All around great great show. Would def watch again.

            <summary> Bad Blood by John Carreyrou </summary>
              <p>
                Okay guys I just reread this for the like I don’t even know anymore. I might honestly make an 
                Elizabeth Holmes shrine in my Things I Love tab because like. My hyperfixation when I was 18
                 went WILD. This book I think does such a good job of really getting inside her head.
                  I reference the part about her wanting to be a billionaire and saying 
                  that the president would marry her because she was a billionaire when 
                  she was a little kid all the effing time. This book has deeply
                   imprinted on my brain. Elizabeth Holmes is truly the blueprint
                    because she just charisma’d her way to having HENRY KISSINGER 
                    (and other war criminals) be genuinely her little bitch. 
                    It’s quite obvious from the start of this book that her tech
                     makes no sense, but she truly went on for over a decade. She fooled
                      WALGREENS?? Like make that make sense. Fear tactics will get you a 
                      long way I guess. I truly am so glad I don’t work in tech because 
                      what if you’re working at a company that you think is gonna help
                       millions of people but in reality you are putting people into 
                       danger etc. That honestly feels like what happens most of the
                        time in tech. This is a whole nother world. I just am so deeply
                         unfamiliar and I think that Carreyrou does a really good job of 
                         developing the story. Highly recommend this read.

                <summary> Alien (1979)</summary>
                <p>
                    Alien (1979):
        This movie is a CLASSIC (says Alex and friends).
         The best part of the movie was when Madeline interrupted
          and said that they had to edit Ripley’s bush out frame by frame.
           I am not that much of a hater actually, I just,, dont like gore
            or scary things and this movie had blood and scary things. 
            Sooooo,,, its really not my fault. It was fun to watch a 
            #throwback like thats cool I guess. And I think if this was 
            1979 and I was watching this for the first time I’d be like 
            wow!! But I was born in 2002 and this movie was really strange 
            to me. Also, I am so sorry but i wouldn’t go back for a cat!! 
            Maybe that makes me a monster but if an alien was attacking
             my ship,, and the ship could go back to the earth and destroy 
             EVERYONE… I simply would leave the cat!!!! But whatever. 
             Also this movie made me realize that I do not have that
              curiosity gene. Like i wouldn’t do all that. It’s just 
              not for me.
