                The Skin and Its Girl by Sarah Cypher
            </summary>
            <p>
                This book took me actually 8 million years to finish… not because it was bad necessarily, but
                 because Swarthmore hates love and light and free time. I think that this is definitely was an 
                 interesting read. It felt a little like Cypher was trying to be really deep with the story, but
                  kind of like the last book it wasn’t hitting exactly right. Like the paragraphs about love and
                   connection just rung a little hollow for me. Maybe I just needed to be more invested in the 
                   characters. And I can accept that I really strung out the book so I lost some of my attachment 
                   to the emotional depth of the story. I do think it was in its own right a pretty beautiful concept, 
                   although I found myself wanting more of some of the fantastical elements. I wish that the world 
                   building was a little more clear, but maybe that’s not the point. I loved the interwoven stories 
                   and yes! I am happy to have finished a book for fun at swarthmore college and I am happy to have 
                   shared this book with my mom and that we are going to book club about it more. Maybe I will update
                    this after our bookclub next week :)

                This Is How You Lose The Time War by Max Gladstone, Amal El-Mohtar
            </summary>
            <p>
                This book was hyped up so much to me by like every book store. And I really wanted to like it. I did 
                in fact want it to change my life. However, it did not. I liked it. I was invested I guess, but I didn’t 
                feel as though it was the best book for me. I can totally get how this could be really perfect for someone 
                else, but just not me. And I love corny stuff, I LOVE CORNINESS. So I’m really confused as to why I didn’t 
                love this. I think maybe just because it wasn’t that human? Like it was talking about human stuff and making 
                human references, but I really just love things that aren’t that fantastical. It feels hard to grab really big 
                feelings that aren’t grounded in real reality. Not to say you should not read this book, if you like corniness and
                 fantastical writing, sure!!!
                 It’s probably a good intro into fantasy too, just not for me.

                Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? By Jeanette Winterson
            </summary>
            <p>
                See,,, Jeanette Winterson the WOMAN THAT YOU ARE… I love her meanderings, her ponderings, her thoughts.
                 This is also just a deeply moving book that definitely had me on the verge several times. It’s a memoir 
                 and gives more insight into Winterson’s life that she wrote a semi-autobiographical retelling of in Oranges
                  Are Not the Only Fruit (a book I have read, but not reviewed here, maybe one day). I just love the way she 
                  writes, it always makes me FEEL. And I love the way she bends fact and fiction with oranges and names some 
                  of that in Why Be Happy. She first recounts her life with adopted mother, then briefly goes through adulthood 
                  and how she came to find her birth mother. She goes through her relationship with love and what it means, to her,
                   to love. I think her musings on love always make me rethink the way I think about love. That is what Written on 
                   the Body is all about for me. Jeanette Winterson and I have led such incredibly different lives but somehow the 
                   way she writes about love just gets me. She also talks about home! How books provide a home, how literature 
                   guides her. I think this book might just inspire me to read a lot more. I LOVE HER. I love her ramblings 
                that come to be so cohesive not through plot but creating a real sense of her. GOD.

                Your Fathers, Where Are They? and the Prophets, Do They Live Forever? by Dave Eggers
            </summary>
            <p>
                OMG MORE BOOKS WITH BIBLE QUOTE TITLES. NEED. The bible has brought a lot of bad, a lot of 
                good, but mostly some absolute BANGER lines. That’s why I picked up this book. I don’t even know 
                the bible like that, but its got a banger title and then its a bible quote you know the book is 
                gonna be interesting. And it really was ! Score!! The book is all dialogue so it moves quickly- 
                finished the book in just a couple of sit down sessions (which is a WIP for me because #attention).
                 I think similar to Seasons of Migration to the North, this book leaves me with no answers, but lots 
                 of questions. It’s one of those books where the politics are so on the nose, but then when you get into
                  it’s does kind of make you wonder (not necessarily think, but wonder). Like why did the author do this 
                  and what does it all mean. The book doesn’t say anything new, but it does make you wonder about how to 
                  grapple with the protagonist who is saying things that make sense but going against all sensible rationale
                  . He IS right, but kidnapping IS wrong. So what do we do with that? Does it further his points, I think a
                   simple read of the book would say no, but really it does. He has some misses, but also he also has his 
                   finger on the pulse. What else could that do but drive you insane? I think more people should read 
                   this and talk to me about it

                Seasons of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih
            </summary>
            <p>
                I really liked this book, mostly because I enjoyed the writing of it. I thought it was 
                super interesting. It took me a minute to get back into after I started reading it first 
                like a year ago. The obvious themes of the impact of British colonialism and resistance 
                (or not) were really intriguing. I think I need to reread it, because I don’t know if I
                 was reading it as critically as I could have been. I am really interested to understand 
                 more about the dynamics of the social and local organizing of the Sudanese people. The 
                 character Mahjoub and others REALLY fascinates me, especially when he is compared and so 
                 close to Mustafa. Okay but getting too into the weeds. I think this book feels more like 
                 an interesting contemplative book rather than one that has you riveted by plot. Which is 
                 okay!!! It’s just the truth. I had to be in the right mood to think and then I could appreciate 
                 the book

                <summary>Written on the Body by Jeanette Winterson</summary>
                <img src="images/writtenonthebody.jpeg">
                <p>This book is quite possible and probably my favorite book 
                    that I have ever read. I love it so much because it’s like
                     so corny and cliche but that’s kind of the whole point. 
                     I have been wanting to write down my thoughts on this book
                      for a minute. I really appreciate this book because it 
                      honestly just made me think about love in super 
                      interesting ways. When I tell people about this book I say 
                      that I read it when I was falling in love for the first time and 
                      it resonated so deeply with me. The irrationality of love is
                       depicted brilliantly. I think I have an affinity for 
                       hyperbolic depictions of emotions because that’s honestly how
                        I feel. I am a dramatic mothereffer so when Winterson describes 
                        this ridiculous way of experiencing love that is all consuming, 
                        I FELT that. The book is half about falling in love and half 
                        about loss. What it feels like to grieve a partner. The first
                         time I read it felt thrilling, to know that what I was
                          risking was epic and intense. The second (well technically
                           third) time I read it, I was actively experiencing this 
                           sense of loss. I think that it complicated the reading a 
                           lot. I think that Winterson plays with what it feels like
                            to feel loss in your body. That love and loss are corporeal
                             experiences. It hurts to love and it hurts to lose. Those
                              are embodied sensations, ones that you often share in 
                              love and are ripped apart from during loss.I don’t want 
                              to spoil the ending too much in case you want to read it
                              , but I think that it offers a grounding to me that intensity 
                              settles. Whether its love or whether its loss, I find comfort 
                              in this depiction that I won’t have to exist in cliches for 
                              the rest of my life. I just love the way Winterson plays with 
                              these cliches and their existence. In one way validating them 
                              and in another making it clear that the language that is classically
                               and poetically associated with love is a little ridiculous. 
                               I don’t honestly think that this makes sense without having 
                               read the book, so you should read it and let’s talk about it! </p>

              <summary> Insecure (HBO show by Issa Rae)</summary>
              <p>
                I just finished this series. It was spectacular. A rare win for Trel watching good television. 
                I was always a little shocked by the raw sex scenes but other than that I have no notes. 
                I think Issa Rae does a great job of just being like yeah life is real and it can be super 
                awkward. Very few shows do that for me. Like I get you Issa, it’s hard and so weird.
                 I really appreciated that aspect of the series. When I hadn’t heard of this show but
                  people were talking about it, they were always talking about the love triangle at the end.
                   HOMIES WHAT LOVE TRIANGLE??? Like Nathan was never that serious for me. I think maybe if 
                   I watch it again I’ll see more of Lawrence’s flaws. But honestly I don’t see themmmm. 
                   Like yeah he’s imperfect and gets chlamydia, but I think he treated the original break up 
                   with respect. Like yeah he’s not gonna stay after he gets cheated on. I’m soooo 
                   anti-cheating but that’s just me. He just seems like a good guy and clearly he and
                    Issa have such good chemistry. And that good like could be friends too chemistry 
                    which is more than what you can say about Nathan. 
        
               <br> Every time Molly and Issa fought it actually made the show deeply hard to watch. 
               Like i love their friendship so bad. Like that’s real stuff. I love them and I was more
                invested in them than I was in either of their relationships. Literally just no way. 
                Each of them fucked up but its like forgive and forgettttttt. 
                All around great great show. Would def watch again.

            <summary> Bad Blood by John Carreyrou </summary>
              <p>
                Okay guys I just reread this for the like I don’t even know anymore. I might honestly make an 
                Elizabeth Holmes shrine in my Things I Love tab because like. My hyperfixation when I was 18
                 went WILD. This book I think does such a good job of really getting inside her head.
                  I reference the part about her wanting to be a billionaire and saying 
                  that the president would marry her because she was a billionaire when 
                  she was a little kid all the effing time. This book has deeply
                   imprinted on my brain. Elizabeth Holmes is truly the blueprint
                    because she just charisma’d her way to having HENRY KISSINGER 
                    (and other war criminals) be genuinely her little bitch. 
                    It’s quite obvious from the start of this book that her tech
                     makes no sense, but she truly went on for over a decade. She fooled
                      WALGREENS?? Like make that make sense. Fear tactics will get you a 
                      long way I guess. I truly am so glad I don’t work in tech because 
                      what if you’re working at a company that you think is gonna help
                       millions of people but in reality you are putting people into 
                       danger etc. That honestly feels like what happens most of the
                        time in tech. This is a whole nother world. I just am so deeply
                         unfamiliar and I think that Carreyrou does a really good job of 
                         developing the story. Highly recommend this read.

                <p>
                    Alien (1979):
        This movie is a CLASSIC (says Alex and friends).
         The best part of the movie was when Madeline interrupted
          and said that they had to edit Ripley’s bush out frame by frame.
           I am not that much of a hater actually, I just,, dont like gore
            or scary things and this movie had blood and scary things. 
            Sooooo,,, its really not my fault. It was fun to watch a 
            #throwback like thats cool I guess. And I think if this was 
            1979 and I was watching this for the first time I’d be like 
            wow!! But I was born in 2002 and this movie was really strange 
            to me. Also, I am so sorry but i wouldn’t go back for a cat!! 
            Maybe that makes me a monster but if an alien was attacking
             my ship,, and the ship could go back to the earth and destroy 
             EVERYONE… I simply would leave the cat!!!! But whatever. 
             Also this movie made me realize that I do not have that
              curiosity gene. Like i wouldn’t do all that. It’s just 
              not for me.

            Challengers
        </summary>
        
            <p>
                Here are my thoughts on the movie Challengers. I LOVED this movie.
                 To be fair I tend not to be a hater. But how could i possibly hate 
                 when it is literally zendaya and two twinks. I loved the way the movie
                  was shot. Also, here’s the thing everyone wants me to pick a side. 
                  Art or Patrick. I can’t do that because I am Art but Patrick is awesome.
                   Like it would be a total betrayal for me to pretend that when Art said 
                   “can you hold me tonight” i didn’t resonateeeee. Because that is me… 
                   but patrick is also just sooo intriguing. Mostly, because that is not
                    my vibe at all. Okay also no offense but Tashi is literally so rachel 
                    berry coded. Like she’s so annoying and will do anything to get her 
                    \goal. She is obsessed with her talent and she cannot let it go. 
                    God like imagine if the laryngitis episode was real??? Like if 
                    rachel hadn’t been able to sing after. She would have been an 
                    entirely different person, Tashi… But this isn’t about Glee. 
                    this is about challengers. Good ass movie. I also thought 
                    there would be more gay sex… but maybe that tension… the edging was 
                    even better. I don’t have a lot of critical thoughts other than 
                    I am Art, Art is me… Patrick is an awesome and if he were ever a real 
                    in person in my life I’d have a fit… Tashi is really a lot… 
                    I could maybe be best friends w her, and I could date in a 
                    toxic way…
