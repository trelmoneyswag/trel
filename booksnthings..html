        <summary>Written on the Body by Jeanette Winterson</summary>
        <img src="images/writtenonthebody.jpeg">
        <p>This book is quite possible and probably my favorite book 
            that I have ever read. I love it so much because it’s like
             so corny and cliche but that’s kind of the whole point. 
             I have been wanting to write down my thoughts on this book
              for a minute. I really appreciate this book because it 
              honestly just made me think about love in super 
              interesting ways. When I tell people about this book I say 
              that I read it when I was falling in love for the first time and 
              it resonated so deeply with me. The irrationality of love is
               depicted brilliantly. I think I have an affinity for 
               hyperbolic depictions of emotions because that’s honestly how
                I feel. I am a dramatic mothereffer so when Winterson describes 
                this ridiculous way of experiencing love that is all consuming, 
                I FELT that. The book is half about falling in love and half 
                about loss. What it feels like to grieve a partner. The first
                 time I read it felt thrilling, to know that what I was
                  risking was epic and intense. The second (well technically
                   third) time I read it, I was actively experiencing this 
                   sense of loss. I think that it complicated the reading a 
                   lot. I think that Winterson plays with what it feels like
                    to feel loss in your body. That love and loss are corporeal
                     experiences. It hurts to love and it hurts to lose. Those
                      are embodied sensations, ones that you often share in 
                      love and are ripped apart from during loss.I don’t want 
                      to spoil the ending too much in case you want to read it
                      , but I think that it offers a grounding to me that intensity 
                      settles. Whether its love or whether its loss, I find comfort 
                      in this depiction that I won’t have to exist in cliches for 
                      the rest of my life. I just love the way Winterson plays with 
                      these cliches and their existence. In one way validating them 
                      and in another making it clear that the language that is classically
                       and poetically associated with love is a little ridiculous. 
                       I don’t honestly think that this makes sense without having 
                       read the book, so you should read it and let’s talk about it! </p>
