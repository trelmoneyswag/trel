    <h1> Sometimes I write a poem... if I decide its not that cringe, it will go here</h1>
   <h3> River Poem! </h3>
    <p> 
        
        I met her halfway <br>
Crouched down <br>
Feet nestled between rocks<br>
Rough edges softened by her relentless current<br>
She wants to take me with her<br>
And we fight<br>
Ripples break against my body<br>
But she is everything <br>
And everything you are not<br>
What we,<br>
Me and her,<br>
Have consumes me<br>
It Is all that I know<br>
Because it is all I need<br>
At first it seemed Mud clouded her waters<br>
A few steps in<br>
She revealed herself <br>
Transparency unknown to me<br>
Surely unknown to you<br>
You taught me after all<br>
Now I feel her on my skin<br>
She is learning<br>
I'm letting her<br>
Because your proprietary claim has expired<br>
She does not own me<br>
Nor I her<br>
So, she is everything <br>
And slowly I feel her wipe you away<br>
But I leave her <br>
And her water dries<br>
Abandoning me<br>
But now there's more of me here<br>
More me than you<br>
She was everything.<br>
