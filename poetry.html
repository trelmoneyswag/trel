    <h1> Sometimes I write a poem... if I decide its not that cringe, it will go here</h1>

    <h3>
        Love is found here
    </h3>
    <p>
    A comet’s remnants shattered the dark night <br>
    That night. <br>
    You must not blink,<br>
    Our orbits met only then<br>
    And <br>
    Love is found briefly somewhere in time<br>
    In the space between <br>
    where collective breaths are held<br>
    you must not blink.<br>
    Love is no bigger than a grain of sand<br>
    Do not forget,<br>
    You must not blink<br>
    Or you will miss its fire<br>
    Close your eyes, dears.<br>
    Listen to my voice <br>
    When I say <br>
    Love is found here,<br>
    every time you and you and I are<br>
    
    </p>
   <h3> River Poem! </h3>
    <p> 
        
        I met her halfway <br>
Crouched down <br>
Feet nestled between rocks<br>
Rough edges softened by her relentless current<br>
She wants to take me with her<br>
And we fight<br>
Ripples break against my body<br>
But she is everything <br>
And everything you are not<br>
What we,<br>
Me and her,<br>
Have consumes me<br>
It Is all that I know<br>
Because it is all I need<br>
At first it seemed Mud clouded her waters<br>
A few steps in<br>
She revealed herself <br>
Transparency unknown to me<br>
Surely unknown to you<br>
You taught me after all<br>
Now I feel her on my skin<br>
She is learning<br>
I'm letting her<br>
Because your proprietary claim has expired<br>
She does not own me<br>
Nor I her<br>
So, she is everything <br>
And slowly I feel her wipe you away<br>
But I leave her <br>
And her water dries<br>
Abandoning me<br>
But now there's more of me here<br>
More me than you<br>
She was everything.<br>
